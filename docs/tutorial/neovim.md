# Neovim in this environment

This environment links the repo-managed Neovim config into `~/.config/nvim`, so the behavior described here is the shared setup, not a one-off local tweak.

## What this setup is trying to be

This Neovim config is intentionally small and practical:

- plain Neovim with a shared `init.lua`
- plugin management through `lazy.nvim`
- fast file and text search through Telescope
- syntax support through treesitter
- markdown-friendly preview tools through Markview
- a few opinionated defaults for navigation, clipboard, splits, and indentation

It is **not** a heavily customized IDE. There is no repo-managed LSP, completion framework, file tree, or large custom command layer. Expect a clean editor with a few well-chosen tools.

## Launching Neovim

Common ways to start it:

```bash
nvim
nvim path/to/file.md
nvim .
```

Recommended habit: **start Neovim from the project or notes directory you want to work in**.

That matters because Telescope searches the current working directory. For example:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ai-notes
nvim .
```

If your shell or another tool opens `$EDITOR`, it will also use Neovim in this setup because the managed shell config exports:

```bash
EDITOR=nvim
VISUAL=nvim
```

That means commands like `git commit` will usually drop you into Neovim automatically.

## First-run and bootstrap expectations

On the first launch after setup, Neovim may do a little work before it feels "ready":

1. `lazy.nvim` bootstraps itself if it is not already installed.
2. Pinned plugins are installed from the lockfile.
3. treesitter parsers for the managed languages may install or update.

This is expected. The setup docs already call out that the first Neovim launch may need time to finish plugin and treesitter bootstrap.

Practical advice:

- let the first launch finish before judging whether something is broken
- if startup looks busy, wait instead of killing it immediately
- after bootstrap, later launches should be much faster

## Managed defaults and conventions

These are the main editor behaviors coming from the tracked config.

### Leader key

The leader key is **Space**.

If you press `Space` and pause briefly, `which-key` can show the available leader mappings.

### Editing defaults

The config enables:

- line numbers
- relative line numbers
- mouse support
- system clipboard integration
- persistent undo
- smart case-insensitive searching
- a visible sign column
- true color
- cursor line highlight
- automatic indentation with spaces, not tabs
- 2-space indent width
- new vertical splits opening to the right
- new horizontal splits opening below

In practice, that means:

- movement by line number is easy because relative numbers are on
- copied text can go to the system clipboard
- undo history survives across sessions
- searching for `note` ignores case, while searching for `Note` respects case
- markdown and config files use two spaces by default

### Small quality-of-life behaviors

- `Esc` in normal mode clears search highlighting
- yanked text briefly highlights so you can see what was copied
- diagnostics use rounded floating windows when they appear
- the default colorscheme is `catppuccin-mocha`

## Everyday navigation and window use

This guide focuses on the managed setup, but these core motions are worth using every day:

- `i` — enter insert mode
- `Esc` — return to normal mode
- `:w` — save
- `:q` — quit
- `:wq` — save and quit
- `/text` — search forward
- `n` / `N` — jump to next/previous match
- `u` — undo
- `Ctrl-r` — redo

### Split navigation

The config adds easy movement between Neovim windows:

- `Ctrl-h` — move to the split on the left
- `Ctrl-j` — move to the split below
- `Ctrl-k` — move to the split above
- `Ctrl-l` — move to the split on the right

Create splits with the usual Vim commands, then move between them with those shortcuts:

```vim
:split
:vsplit
```

Because splits open right and below by default, the layout is predictable.

## File search and workspace search

This setup uses Telescope for the main search flows.

### Keybindings

- `Space f f` — find files
- `Space f g` — live grep text in the current working directory
- `Space f b` — switch buffers
- `Space f h` — search help tags

### How to use it well

#### Find a file

Open Neovim in the directory you care about, then press:

```text
Space f f
```

Start typing part of a filename and press Enter.

Example:

1. `cd ~/Documents/ai-notes`
2. `nvim .`
3. `Space f f`
4. type `tmux`
5. press Enter on the note you want

#### Search across a repo or notes directory

```text
Space f g
```

Type the text you want to search for and Telescope will use ripgrep to show matches.

Good uses:

- find every note mentioning `ghostty`
- find unfinished checklist items by searching for `- [ ]`
- search config files for `clipboard` or `tmux`

#### Switch between open files

```text
Space f b
```

This is the quick way to bounce between a few active buffers without reopening them from scratch.

### Practical expectations

- `find_files` is best when you roughly know the filename
- `live_grep` is best when you know text inside the file
- searches are rooted in the directory where you launched Neovim
- this setup installs `fd`, `fzf`, and `ripgrep`, so the search workflow is designed around those command-line tools being present

## Markdown workflow

This environment is clearly optimized for markdown-heavy work.

### Built for markdown notes and docs

treesitter is explicitly installed for:

- `markdown`
- `markdown_inline`
- `yaml`
- `json`
- `toml`
- `lua`
- `bash`
- `vim`
- `vimdoc`
- `query`

That makes the setup especially comfortable for:

- notes
- documentation
- README edits
- shell/config work

### Markdown preview controls

In markdown buffers, Markview adds these leader mappings:

- `Space m t` — toggle markdown preview
- `Space m h` — toggle hybrid markdown view
- `Space m s` — toggle split markdown view

You do not need these all the time. A simple workflow is:

1. open a markdown file
2. write normally
3. use `Space m t` when you want a richer preview
4. use `Space m s` if you want a split-oriented preview workflow
5. toggle it back off when you want a plain editing view again

If you prefer mostly raw markdown, that is fine too. This setup does not force preview mode on you.

### A practical note-writing flow

Example:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ai-notes
nvim .
```

Then inside Neovim:

1. `Space f f` to open or create the note you want
2. write headings, lists, links, and code fences normally
3. use `Space m t` if you want to preview rendered markdown
4. use `/` search to jump around long notes
5. use `Space f g` to search across the whole notes repo

Because the repo is markdown-first and this config keeps the editor fairly plain, files stay easy to edit in either Neovim or VS Code.

## Git-aware editing

This setup includes `gitsigns.nvim`, so in a git repo you may see change markers in the sign column next to modified lines.

That is helpful context while editing, but there are **no custom git keybindings defined in this config**. For git actions, expect to keep using normal terminal commands such as:

```bash
git status
git diff
git commit
```

A very practical pattern is to keep Neovim open in one tmux pane and git commands in another.

## Working well with tmux

This environment is designed for tmux and Neovim to be used together.

### tmux behaviors from the managed config

The shared tmux config enables:

- mouse support
- clipboard integration
- vi-style copy mode keys
- pane and window numbering starting at 1
- automatic renumbering of windows

Useful tmux bindings from the managed config:

- `prefix + |` — split pane vertically
- `prefix + -` — split pane horizontally
- `prefix + c` — create a new window
- `prefix + h/j/k/l` — move between tmux panes
- `prefix + r` — reload tmux config

### Neovim splits vs tmux panes

A good mental model:

- use **Neovim splits** for closely related files in one editing task
- use **tmux panes** when you want editor + shell side by side
- use **tmux windows** for separate task contexts

Also note the navigation pattern:

- inside **Neovim**, use `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` to move between editor splits
- inside **tmux**, use `prefix + h/j/k/l` to move between tmux panes

The keys are intentionally similar, but they are not the same layer.

### Example tmux + Neovim workflow

1. Start tmux.
2. Open a pane for Neovim.
3. Split another pane for shell commands.
4. In the editor pane, run `nvim .` from the repo root.
5. In the shell pane, run `git status`, `git diff`, tests, or search commands.

That gives you a very efficient "edit here, verify there" setup.

## What not to expect from this config

To avoid confusion, here is what this managed setup does **not** currently provide:

- no repo-managed language server setup
- no repo-managed autocompletion framework
- no repo-managed file tree sidebar
- no large custom command palette beyond Telescope and which-key
- no custom cross-over tmux/Neovim navigation plugin

That is intentional. The setup is lightweight and focused on editing, search, markdown work, and terminal-driven workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### First launch seems slow

That is usually plugin bootstrap or treesitter installation.

What to do:

- wait for the first launch to finish
- quit and reopen Neovim after bootstrap completes

### `lazy.nvim` fails to install

The config clones `lazy.nvim` from GitHub on first use.

Check:

- `git` is installed and on `PATH`
- network access is working
- you can reach GitHub from the machine

### `Space f g` does not work

`live_grep` depends on `ripgrep`.

Check:

```bash
rg --version
```

Also make sure you started Neovim in the directory you actually want to search.

### `Space f f` is not finding the file you expected

Usually one of these is true:

- you launched Neovim from the wrong directory
- the file is outside the current working tree
- you are expecting a file browser, but this setup is centered on Telescope search instead

A reliable fix is:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
nvim .
```

### Clipboard copy/paste feels wrong

This setup enables clipboard integration in both Neovim and tmux, but clipboard behavior still depends on the terminal and OS session being healthy.

If it feels off:

- confirm you are in the managed terminal environment
- confirm tmux is using the tracked config
- try yanking in Neovim again after opening a fresh terminal session

### Markdown preview commands do nothing

Markview is loaded for markdown buffers.

Check:

- you are editing a markdown file
- the filetype is really markdown
- you used one of the markdown mappings: `Space m t`, `Space m h`, or `Space m s`

### A keybinding does not seem to exist

This config intentionally defines only a small number of custom mappings. If you are expecting a common plugin mapping from some other Neovim setup, it may simply not be part of this one.

When in doubt:

- press `Space` and wait for `which-key`
- use `:help`
- fall back to standard Vim commands

## Recommended daily habits

If you want this setup to feel natural quickly, these habits help:

1. launch `nvim .` from the directory you actually want to work in
2. use `Space f f` for filenames and `Space f g` for text search
3. use tmux panes for editor + shell side by side
4. use `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` inside Neovim splits
5. use `Space m ...` only when working in markdown
6. remember that the setup is intentionally lightweight; when unsure, standard Vim behavior is usually the right fallback

That combination matches what this environment is optimized for: terminal-first editing, markdown-heavy notes and docs, and quick movement between Neovim, tmux, and shell commands.
